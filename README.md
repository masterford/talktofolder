## Technical Architecture

### Pinecone Assistant Integration

This project uses **Pinecone Assistant** for document storage and retrieval. Due to limitations on the free Pinecone plan (10 documents per assistant), we implement a batching strategy:

- Multiple files are combined into larger documents (up to 10MB each)
- Each file's content is prefixed with a clear header: `=== FILE: filename ===`
- When re-indexing, old documents are deleted first to prevent duplicates

**Note for Developers**: The codebase also includes support for regular Pinecone indexes (see `/api/chat` and `/api/folders/[id]/index`). You can easily swap between Pinecone Assistant and regular Pinecone by using the appropriate endpoints.
